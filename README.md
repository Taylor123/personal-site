# Personal Site
(Still a work in progress)

# Purpose
  This site is to show some of the projects I've been working on, display my interests, and ultimately convey my knowledge of software development.

# Improvements to be made
  - Serve static assets over a cdn, not the Express server
  - Optimize Webpack output
  - Add employment history
  - Add more projects
  - Create API for project data, vs json file
